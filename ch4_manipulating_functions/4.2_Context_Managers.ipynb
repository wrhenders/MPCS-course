    "It's called a **context manager** because it wraps your code in a box (a context). The box is opened, the code is run, and then the box is shut. Regardless of what happens when the code runs, the box is always shut. That way, if the code in the box explodes, you can shut the box to clean up the mess!\n",

    "- ``__exit__(self, type, value, traceback)`` is executed at the end of a with block and performs any \"cleanup\" actions. If there is an exception that occurs between the ``__enter__`` and the calling of ``__exit__`` then python calls ``__exit__`` with the information about the exception via these three parameters. This step allows the ``__exit__`` method to decide how to hanlde the exception and if any further steps are required to cleanup. "
