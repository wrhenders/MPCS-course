    "\n",
    "An **exception** is an event that can modify the flow of control through a program:\n",
    " \n",
    " - Initiated (\"thrown\", \"raised\") automatically on errors. Initiated and caught optionally by your code.\n",
    " - Allow us to jump out of arbitrarily large chunks of code. Mainly used for error-handling but can be useful for:\n",
    "      - Event Notification – raise an exception in the event of a failure\n",
    "      - Special-Case Handling – when a condition rarely occurs then raise an exception instead convoluting your code to handle a special condition in multiple places.\n",
    "      - In really gnarly cases, logging: Some frameworks, such as React Native, redirect your Standard Out (stdout) output in asynchronous code, such that your print statements `console.log(\"string\")` don't show up in your console. But if you throw an exception, that output goes to Standard Error (stderr), which WILL show up in your console.\n",
