    "When we talk about Python as we know it, we're usually referring specifically to the way that Python syntax looks. That part of the programming language is called the **front end** in compiler design parlance. That's not the step where compilation decisions live. That's just the _interface_ that you use to write the programming language. Several different compilers can execute the same front end code in different ways. These are called **compiler implementations**.\n",

Meanwhile, JRuby is written in Java and runs on the JVM. You write Ruby the same in either one, though. The \"standard distribution\" of Python uses the CPython intepreter, which...you guessed it!...is written in C.\n",
