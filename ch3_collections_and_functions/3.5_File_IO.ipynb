    "\n",
    "1. Read the contents of a file (or files) and load them into the program (sometimes referrred to as \"loading into memory\"). \n",
    "    - This means we read in the contents from a file and place it inside of a data structure for further processing. \n",

    "2. Manipulate the data in some way. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. (Optional) Write the data back to disk. \n",

    "**Note**: When working with large files, it may be more efficient to slectively access parts of the file (to avoid reading in the whole dataset into memory); however, we will not worry about that case. "
