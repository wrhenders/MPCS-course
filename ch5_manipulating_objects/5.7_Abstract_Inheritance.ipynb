    "An **abstract class** is a class that cannot be instantiated. The class is mainly used to define an *interface*, which contains a collection of methods that a **concrete class** (i.e., a subclass of the abstract base class) must implement. We introduced this concept in [this previous video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ezwlq92BiAw&list=PLwWm3SC4yPMyOOdY0zozd9Cn5kHtticoI&index=13&ab_channel=ChelseaTroy), but now let's talk more in-depth.\n",
