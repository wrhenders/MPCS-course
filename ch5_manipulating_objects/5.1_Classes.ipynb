    "### Types/Classes and Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Python 2.2, types and classes are functionally identical (though we typically use \"type\" to descibe a builtin type and \"class\" to describe a type of our own design).<sup>1</sup> The **type/class** is where we define the state and behavior that all objects of this type/class will have. The **objects** are individual **instances** of that type/class.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For more on the history of this change, see [this piece](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.2.3/descrintro/) by Guido Van Rossum. In general, I think this piece also provides a self-contained example that gives you some insight into:\n",
    "- How programming language design decisions are made\n",
    "- How open source project maintainers (especially of projects as widely used as Python) communicate with their communities\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In making this change, Python became more like Ruby, in which all types are objects that can accept methods and do all the things objects do. This isn't a given for a language, though: for example, the primitive types in Java aren't (and don't function like) objects, and in Golang you _can_ treat the primitive types the way you'd treat objects, but Golang [doesn't exactly have inheritance](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inheritance-in-golang/), so you have to subclass both types and objects with **struct embedding**."

A closer corollary to Java's constructors is the Python method `__new__`, which gets called _before_ `__init__` when you call a class to get a new instance of it. That method is a thing called a **static method** that returns an instance of the class, and then `__init__` is called _on that instance_. In the vast majority of cases, you shouldn't mess with the `__new__` method, and putting your initialization code in `__init__` should be fine.
